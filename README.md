# Chef-and-Proportion
CodeChef Difficulty 1122 Problem. 

Proportion Checker

Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions, and now heâ€™s curious if he can form a valid proportion using four positive integers.

Problem Statement-

Chef has four positive integers: a, b, c, and d.

He wants to know whether he can rearrange (shuffle) these numbers into four values x, y, z, w such that:
x : y = z : w

In other words: 
x * w = y * z

You must determine whether any permutation of the numbers a, b, c, d can form a valid proportion.

Input-

A single line containing four space-separated positive integers: a b c d

Output- 

Print "Possible" if the numbers can be shuffled to form a proportion, otherwise print "Impossible".
